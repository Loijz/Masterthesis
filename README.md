Masterthesis R Code

In the folder Masterthesis you can find all code from my Masterthesis "Stories. No Algorithms: How Stories Shape Forecast Convergence in Commodity Markets". 
All R code has been created in R Studio. Webscraping has been created in Python with Visual Studio to create my own Dataset. The second Dataset is from FocusEconomics, which is not publicly available. Therefore, I cannot publish the dataset in this repo. This is for checkups only.
